Description:   
At 'We Rate Dogs', we try our best to give dogs accurate ratings, which will always be above 10/10. Because they're good dogs. Over the weekend Bront has come in and hacked our system, lowering the ratings of dogs to below 10/10. 
Please help to fix Brant's bad system and give the dogs their original ratings. _They're good dogs Brent._

Task:  
The `function weRateDogs(str, rating)` takes a string and an integer as the inputs. Within the string is an incorrect rating x/y. 

You will need to change the incorrect rating `x/y` to the correct rating `rating/10`. The given string may contain numbers and letters, but no special characters other than `/`. 

For example:  
if you are given the following string:  
`'This is Max99. She has one ear that is always s1ightly higher than the other 4/10 wonky af'`  
And the following rating: `11`
return: `'This is Max99. She has one ear that is always s1ightly heigher than the other 11/10 wonky af'`
