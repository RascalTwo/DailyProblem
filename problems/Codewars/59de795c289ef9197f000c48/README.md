It happened decades before Snapchat, years before Twitter and even before Facebook. Targeted advertising was a bit of a challenge back then. One day, the marketing professor at my university told us a story that I am yet to confirm using reliable sources. Nevertheless, I retold the story to dozens of my students already, so, sorry BMW if it is all a big lie.

Allegedly, BMW, in an attempt to target the educated, produced billboard posters featuring the English alphabet with three letters missing: B, M and W. Needless to say, many were confused, some to the extent of road accidents.

Your task is to write a function that takes one parameter str that MUST be a string and removes all capital and small letters B, M and W.  
If data of the wrong data type was sent as a parameter the function must throw an error with the following specific message: 

```python
TypeError("This program only works for text.")
```
```javascript
new Error("This program only works for text.");
```
```ruby
"This program only works for text."
```
```groovy
new IllegalArgumentException("This program only works for text.")
```

For Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html)'s a good resource you might need for the exception type ;)
