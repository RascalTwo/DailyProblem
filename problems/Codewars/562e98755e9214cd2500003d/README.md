Our friend Pac has finally decided to pursue a career in the coding industry.  
He is a newbie, he needs to learn properly.  
Therefore, Pac wants to apply for the worldwide famous -and very demanding-  
 'C0d3r 1ns1d3' Academy for beginners.  
In order to join, Pac is required to solve a series of 3 exercises about 'Bug Fixes'.  
He has been sent an email from the Academy with the following instructions,

<pre><code>Dear Pac,  
This is the first exercise. Find out what's wrong and fix the code.  
You have 15 minutes to send a solution.  
Good Luck.</pre></code>

This code is a mess! Would you help Pac to fix the code in time?

This is my first Kata, so please any feedback (especially on Test Cases) is welcome!
