# Four Seven

```if:python
Simple kata, simple rules: your function should accept the inputs `4` and `7`.  If `4` is entered, the function should return `7`.  If `7` is entered, the function should return `4`.  Anything else entered as input should return a false-y value such as `False`, `0`, `[]`, `""`. There's only one catch, your function cannot include if statements (or the eval function due to the fact that you can get around the if requirement using it).

There are some *very* simple ways of answering this problem, but I encourage you to try and be as creative as possible.

Good Luck!

Anything else entered as input should return `0`. There's only one catch. This is Lambda Calculus. You have to make any if, case, switch or guard expressions yourself.

( This kata uses Church numerals. )

```if:haskell
Simple kata, simple rules: your function should accept the inputs `4` and `7`.  If `4` is entered, the function should return `Just 7`.  If `7` is entered, the function should return `Just 4`.  Anything else entered as input should return `Nothing`. There's only one catch, your function cannot include if expressions, case expressions, or guards.
