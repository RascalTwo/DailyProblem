##The Misadventures of Bob the Highly Paid Consultant
###Chapter 1: Promises Made and Broken

Your company has purchased a new ordering system and hired Bob the Highly Paid Consultant to develop a front end.  However, after continuous delays and missed deliverables, his contract has now come to an end.  Bob vanishes like a ghost into the fog, leaving you to see if you can salvage the pieces of his work.

One thing is clear:  Bob has left a chain of broken promises in his wake.

Can you help to fix things?

Some notes:

1. You can assume that the functions Bob is calling actually exist and take the given parameters in the given order.
2. User "12345" is a valid user for testing
3. Any provided function whose name ends in Async returns a Promise.
4. Any provided function whose name does not end in Async is synchronous, i.e. calculateShipping().

As you may have gathered, the purpose of this Kata is to familiarize yourself with using JavaScript [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for asynchronous programming.
