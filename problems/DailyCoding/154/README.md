# 154

Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

- `push(item)`
	- adds an element to the stack
- `pop()`
  - removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:

- `push(item)`
  - adds a new key to the heap
- `pop()`
  - removes and returns the max value of the heap
