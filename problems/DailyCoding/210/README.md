# 210

A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer:

if `n` is even, the next number in the sequence is `n / 2`
if `n` is odd, the next number in the sequence is `3n + 1`

It is conjectured that every such sequence eventually reaches the number 1. Test this conjecture.

Bonus: What input `n <= 1000000` gives the longest sequence?
