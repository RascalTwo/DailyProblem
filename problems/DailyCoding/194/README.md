# 194

Suppose you are given two lists of `n` points, one list `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` on the line `y = 0` and the other list `q1`, `q2`, ..., `qn` on the line `y = 1`.

Imagine a set of `n` line segments connecting each point `pi` to `qi`.

Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.
