# 275

The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning any term, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term.

The first few terms are as follows:

```
1
11
21
1211
111221
```

As an example, the fourth term is `1211`, since the third term consists of `one 2` and `one 1`.

Given an integer `N`, print the `N`th term of this sequence.
