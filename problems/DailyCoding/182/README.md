# 182

A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving the graph connected.

For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.

Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected.

You can choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
