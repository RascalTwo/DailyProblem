# 051

Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between `1` and `k` (inclusive), where `k` is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.

It should run in `O(N)` time.

Hint: Make sure each one of the `52!` permutations of the deck is equally likely.
