# 084

Given a matrix of `1`s and `0`s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A `1` represents land and `0` represents water, so an island is a group of `1`s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

For example, this matrix has `4` islands.

```
1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
```
